# Archived Status

VMware is pausing efforts to continue the development of the Streaming Runtime Operator. This effort was bigger than we expected with the resources available at hand, and our hope is to continue the development of the Streaming Runtime Operator when the team and contributors grow.

## Where do we stop?

With the current implementation of the Streaming Runtime project, you can build a simple streaming pipeline using the `Processor` and `Stream` resources provided by the operator. Learn more about what you do with them in the [Usage](https://vmware-tanzu.github.io/streaming-runtimes/streaming-runtime-overview/) section.

## How to reach the team

You are welcome to create an issue in this repository or ask a question on [Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C03GFRBHM43).
