### 2.1 Multibinder Bridge - production env

In production environment the Streaming Runtime will not be allowed to auto-provision the messaging brokers dynamically. 
Instead the Administrator will provision the required messaging middleware and declare ClusterStream to provide managed and controlled access to it.

The ClusterStreams and the Streams follow the PersistentVolume model: 
namespaced Stream declared by a developer (ala PVC) is backed by a ClusterStream resource (ala PV) which is controlled and provisioned by the administrator.
