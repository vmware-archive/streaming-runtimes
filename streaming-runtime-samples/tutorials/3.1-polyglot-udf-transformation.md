### 3.1 Polyglot UDF Transformation

The (SRP) Processor can be assigned with custom User Defined Function running in a sidecar container next to the processor in the same Pod.
Processor calls the UDF either for every received message or in the case of temporal aggregation calls it once the aggregate is ready. 

The communication between the Processor and the custom UDF is performed over gRPC using well defined Protocol Buffer contract. 
Because the Protocol Buffers are language-neutral, this allows implementing the UDF in any language of choice! (e.g. polyglot UDF).

Detailed UDF documentation: https://vmware-tanzu.github.io/streaming-runtimes/architecture/processors/srp/udf-overview/

Note: The inline transformations can be applied on the outbound message (e.g. the UDF response) before it is sent.

Note: SRP specific feature.
