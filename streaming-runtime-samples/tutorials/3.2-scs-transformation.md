### 3.2  SCS (Spring Cloud Stream) Transformation

Any [Spring Cloud Stream](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-stream) or [Spring Cloud Function](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-function) application can be run as Processor.
Just build a container image for the application and run it as `spec.type: SCS`` Processor type.

Spring Cloud DataFlow provides [60+ pre-built SCS/SCF applications](https://docs.spring.io/stream-applications/docs/2021.1.2/reference/html/#applications) that can be used Out-Of-The-Box

Use the environment variables to configure the Spring application.
