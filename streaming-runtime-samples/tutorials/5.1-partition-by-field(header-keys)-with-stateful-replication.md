### 5.1 Partition by Field using Header Keys

Variation of the 5-partition-by-field-with-stateful-replication.yaml that uses message headers as partitioning keys. 
The 'spec.keys' value in the partitioned Stream must exist as a header name in the messages carried by that stream.

Also the 'data-in-stream' and 'team-scores-stream' Stream definitions are dropped in favor of auto-provisioned defaults.
